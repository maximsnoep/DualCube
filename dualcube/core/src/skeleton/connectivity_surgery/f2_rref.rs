//! Sparse linear algebra over GF(2) (the field with two elements).
//!
//! Each row is stored as a sorted `Vec<u32>` of nonzero column indices;
//! row addition is the symmetric difference of two sorted index lists,
//! computed with a two-pointer merge. This is what's needed for tracking
//! the rank of a sparse Z/2 boundary matrix incrementally.
//!
//! The matrix supports soft-deleting rows (replace with the empty row) so
//! that external `face_id -> row_index` maps stay valid across deletes.
//! Columns are likewise never renumbered: `merge_columns(a, b)` collapses
//! column `b` into column `a` in place, after which `b` is empty for life.
